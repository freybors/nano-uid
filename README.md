# nano-uid

A tiny, speakable unique ID generator.

## Install

```shell
$ npm install nano-uid
```

## Usage

Use `uid.generate(length, callback)` to generate ids.

By default, `nano-uid` uses an in-memory store to make sure it doesn't create duplicates.

```javascript
var uidFactory = require('nano-uid');
var uid = uidFactory();

uid.generate(5, function (err, id) {
  // id will have a length of 5 (or more, if you're out of 5 letter ids!)
  console.log(id);
});
```

### Bring-your-own memory

If you'd like persistent memory storage, you'll need to provide your own *memorizer*. The default, in-memory memorizer can be found at [lib/memorizer.js] â€“ the API is very simple!

### Entropy

If you want no-so speakable ids you can set `uid.entropy` to some number (0-10) is a good range. This will introduce randomness to the generation.
